# Data-Prepration-in-Python
* It is well-known in the realm of Data Science/ML Engineering that 80% of any project is devoted to the data prepration. Because without a clean data ready to be put into the model what we will have would be "garbage in - garbage out'. Hence in this repo I tried to cover the most common cases that we deal with during data prepration as well as an industry standard step by step instruction that covers all different data types that one may face. 
* All the content of this repo is just the summary of my learning from avilable resources (e.g. [Mike West](https://www.logikbot.com/)
