## Data-Prepration-in-Python
* It is well-known in the realm of Data Science/ML Engineering that 80% of any project is devoted to the data prepration. Because without a clean data ready to be put into the model what we will have would be "garbage in - garbage out'. Hence in this repo I tried to cover the most common cases that we deal with during data prepration as well as an industry standard step by step instruction that covers all different data types that one may face. 
* All the content of this repo is just the summary of my learning from avilable resources (e.g. [Mike West](https://www.logikbot.com/) and [Jason Brownlee](https://machinelearningmastery.com/))  

### Instruction
* If you looking for specific method then feel free to directly look at to the related folder. If not here is my suggestion
  + 1. Intro data cleansing
  + 2. Data Cleansing Master
  + 3. Feature Engineering - Titanic Case Study
* In each folder there are Notes that provide a breif review of each method (e.g. what they do?, why/where we should use them?). Additional there is a Jupyternotebook for each method with codes and some comments for the sake of clarification.
