    " * Here mostly the all steps from loading a dataset up to the execution of models are applied in a sequence which is kind of ML procedure standard and is practiced by majority of data scientist/ML engineers. Nothing new but I thought it wouldn't be a bad idea to write them here in steps. \n",

    "    + Well it seems that there is no consensus among Data scientist that where exactly we should do the train/test split. But personally think that where ever that our Data cleansing,Feature engineering, and Feature selection techniques may lead to the Data Leakage then we should do those steps after trian/test split. Where Data Leakage happens? good question! I don't know, I think it somehow depends to our personal judgement but I would say if you are not sure then do some googleing. \n",
